# Portfolio Streamlit App

## Overview
This portfolio website is built using Streamlit, a powerful web application framework in Python. Originally designed as an extended resume, the project evolved into a unique time capsule, documenting key moments and achievements since the developer's formal education at the age of 7. The application showcases the power and aesthetics of Streamlit, which sets it apart from other front-end frameworks like Angular and Bootstrap. While Streamlit is commonly used for dashboarding, its extensive features make it an appealing choice for this personal project.
